# Share-Your-Notes
A simple Course Notes sharing app. One can generate a PDF file from multiple images or can share an existing PDF file directly. 
Users can also request for courses which will be shown in the request news feed. Users can also request for courses which will be shown in the request news feed.

Tools and Libraries:

* `JAVA`
* `xml`
* `Firebase Authectication`
* `Firebase Realtime Database`
* `iText`

Users can register with there Google account. Some of users basic informations are gathered from their Google Id's credentials. Also, users can search the PDF files with course code and name. I am planning for a rating option on my future update for this app.
